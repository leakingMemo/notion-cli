# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

#### Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following our coding standards

3. Write or update tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Run linting and formatting:
   ```bash
   black notion_cli tests
   flake8 notion_cli tests

### Coding Standards

#### Python Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for formatting
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

#### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Test changes
- `chore:` Build process or auxiliary tool changes

Examples:
```
feat: add database export to Excel format
fix: handle empty search results gracefully
docs: update installation instructions
```

#### Code Structure

- Keep functions small and focused
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Handle errors gracefully with helpful messages

### Testing

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=notion_cli

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_client.py

# Run tests matching pattern
pytest -k "test_search"
```

#### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%)
- Use fixtures for common test data
- Mock external API calls
- Test both success and error cases

Example test:
```python
def test_search_with_query(mock_notion_client):
    """Test search with a query string."""
    mock_notion_client.search.return_value = [
        {"id": "1", "title": "Test Page"}
    ]
    
    results = mock_notion_client.search(query="test")
    
    assert len(results) == 1
    assert results[0]["title"] == "Test Page"
    mock_notion_client.search.assert_called_once_with(query="test")
```

### Documentation

#### Docstring Format

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def search(query: str, limit: int = 10) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Search for pages and databases.
    
    Args:
        query: Search query string
        limit: Maximum number of results
        
    Returns:
        List of search results
        
    Raises:
        NotionAPIError: If the API request fails
    """
```

#### Updating Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update docstrings for API changes
- Add examples for new features
- Keep the CLI help text up to date
